The objective of this exercise is to design a login screen for a user. You are required
to implement user account management as a swing app.
There will be one login screen. Based on user role (admin or regular user) there will
be screens shown in the same window.
Regular user:
● A regular user can only view and update his personal details.
● Logged-in user info is shown on the user account JPanel. There is a feature
to update personal information including passwords.
● Maintain an array list storing the history of passwords. If a user decides to
update their password, your app must block them from using a previously
used password.
● All passwords must be saved as hashes.
For regular users, there should be a menu that would invoke the following 2 panels.
1)View the personal information
2) Update the personal information (including username and password)
Admin:
Create an array list of persons and another array list of users. Each user record must
have 4 fields: user ID, NUID, user name, password (hash), enabled, and role
(regular user or admin). One user in the list of users will be admin with NUID null.
There will be no person associated with it.
For admin, there should be a menu that would invoke the following 5 panels.
1) Add a new person.
2) List all the persons.
3) Search for a person by NUID.
4) Create a new user. Enter NUID, user name, password, and enabled.
5) Manage user. Search user by NUID. Update user name, and password and
enable
